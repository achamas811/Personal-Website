            Hello! My name is Alexandra and I am a sophomore at Stony Brook University majoring in Computer Science. I am in the Computer Science Honors Program and in the Women in Science and Engineering Honors Program. My computer science journey has led me to develop a strong interest in data science. I am excited to explore how data can be used to solve complex problems and tell meaningful stories. Welcome to my website where you will find information about me, my projects, and my contact information.

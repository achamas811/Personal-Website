            Hello! My name is Alexandra and I am a sophomore at Stony Brook University majoring in Computer Science.
            Welcome to my website! This is where you will find information about me, my projects, and my contact
            information.

        <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
        <p id="aboutMeBlurb">
            I am in the Computer Science Honors Program and in the Women in Science and Engineering Honors Program. My
            journey in computer science started with a JavaScript course on Khan Academy, sparking my excitement for
            coding. This led me to participate in other programs such as Girls Who Code and Tech Scholars, both programs
            to support women interested in pursuing a career in the tech industry. These experiences led me to develop a
            strong interest in data science. I am excited to explore how data can be used to solve complex problems and
            tell meaningful stories. While I am still a student, I did complete one data science project, which is in
            the "Projects" tab of my website! Additionally, I participate in the Cybersecurity Club at Stony Brook
            University. In my free time, some of my hobbies include boxing, swimming, and crocheting.

                size and the average number of years for female schooling in Colombia and Peru. The data used is from
                the "livwell135.csv" file. The data used for analysis is from 2000 - 2015. By analyzing this data, I was
                able to answer the following research question: How do geographical, social, and economic events impact
                a young woman&#39s ability to continue in school?</div>
